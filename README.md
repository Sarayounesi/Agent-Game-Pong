# Agent-Pong-Game

Pong AI with Deep Q-Learning

This project implements a Deep Q-Learning algorithm to play the classic Pong game using the Gymnasium library. The agent learns to optimize its actions based on the state of the game, using features such as ball and paddle positions. Key components include:

•  State Representation: Extracts features like ball position and paddle distance.

•  Q-Learning: Updates weights based on the reward and future rewards.

•  Training: Runs multiple episodes to train the agent.
